# GraphTorch

Graph Torch is a website for graph analysis. Users can push their own graph files onto the GitHub first. The they can specify the file path in the graph analysis page. After clicking the torch button, the backend will automatically analyze the graph file. There are two types of graphs can be analyzed, homogeneous and heterogenous. The file format for each graph file is specified in "About" page. For each types of graphs, the analysis includes reciprocities, edge entropy and gini coefficients etc. Some results will also be plotted.
